My plan is to constantly update this repository so everyone is working with a live version of the code.
Only problem is if one person makes a large edit to a class or the application it may affect how everyone's code will run.
What I want to avoid is having the code only on one person's computer.

When updating the application file, just paste in the changes you made, do not copy and paste in the entire code because that may fuck up someone else's revision of the application
any changes to the cdf should be announced in the groupme because a change to one cdf could disrupt multiple functions
